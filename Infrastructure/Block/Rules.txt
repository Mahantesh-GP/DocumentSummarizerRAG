Detect dependencies listed in vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD, OWASP Dependency-Check).

Flag dependencies not updated to the latest stable version.

<!-- UNSAFE: Using an outdated Entity Framework Core -->  
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="3.1.0" />  

 Ensure CI/CD pipelines include dependency scanning.

 Detect usage of deprecated methods/classes (e.g., WebClient in .NET).

 Ensure an SBOM is generated to track all components (e.g., using CycloneDX).

 Detect dependencies with no recent updates or community support.

 Flag insecure defaults (e.g., MongoDB without authentication, Redis exposed publicly).

 Scan indirect dependencies pulled in by direct packages.

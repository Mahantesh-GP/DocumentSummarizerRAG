Following our recent meeting, I have outlined the key discussion points regarding the POC implementation. Please find the details below:

1. GPT Naming and Configuration:

Each GPT should have a unique name per user.

A Configure and Preview screen should be included before creating or saving a GPT.

The Preview chat history/conversations should not be stored.



2. User Interface and Experience Enhancements:

The "Conversation Starter" section should be renamed to Examples.

When editing a GPT, the GPT name should remain non-editable.

A checkbox should be added for enabling/disabling web search.



3. Database Design Adjustments:

The capability field should be removed from the database design.

The database should include only a single GPTs table.

A checkbox should be added to mark GPTs as private or public.



4. Explore & Collaboration Features:

Clicking the Explore button should open a popup allowing users to create, search, and select GPTs.

A delete option should be provided in the Explore popup for GPT management.

Users should have the ability to subscribe/unsubscribe from shared GPTs.

The Explore popup should categorize GPTs into:

Search GPTs

Shared GPTs

Private GPTs




5. POC Priorities:

In the initial phase of the POC, we are prioritizing the Show, Preview, Search, and Collaboration functionalities.

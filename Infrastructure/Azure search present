Evaluation Report: Phonetic & Fuzzy Search Alternatives to Azure AI Search


---

1. Context & Objective

The goal of this evaluation was to identify cost-effective alternatives to Azure AI Search for performing phonetic, fuzzy, and text-based name searches across a dataset of approximately 1.36 billion records.

While Azure AI Search provides strong out-of-box capabilities, including custom analyzers, hybrid and vector search, and high availability, its cost at this scale (â‰ˆ $2 K â€“ $4 K per month using S2 tier with 4â€“6 SUs) prompted exploration of other managed and PaaS-based solutions.

5. Option 3 â€“ RedisSearch (Managed Redis Enterprise on Azure)

Overview

In-memory text search engine embedded in Redis Enterprise.

Supports phonetic search (PHONETIC dm:en), prefix, and fuzzy matching.

Designed for ultra-fast lookup and filter queries in milliseconds.


Cost Estimate

Component	Estimate (USD / Month)	Notes

Redis Enterprise Cluster (50â€“100 GB RAM)	700 â€“ 1,200	Managed cache tier
Data Persistence / Backups	100	Optional snapshot persistence
Total Estimate	800 â€“ 1,300 USD / month	Fast but limited index capacity


Pros / Cons

âœ… Sub-millisecond query latency
âœ… Minimal maintenance
ðŸŸ¥ Not ideal for multi-terabyte datasets


---

6. Option 4 â€“ Azure Function + SQL Server or PostgreSQL

Architecture

Azure Function performs phonetic encoding (Double Metaphone + Beider-Morse).

Database stores phonetic codes for each name.

Similarity scoring via Jaro-Winkler or Damerau-Levenshtein.

Queries run on normalized codes â†’ millisecond latency.


Implementation Pattern

1. Ingestion: Bulk insert via SqlBulkCopy.


2. Indexing: Build indexes with ONLINE = ON and scheduled maintenance per bucket.


3. Azure Function: Durable Function fan-out/fan-in for batch processing.


4. Cold Path: Corpus resides in DB storage; Azure Functions trigger lookups on demand.



Cost Estimate

Component	Estimate (USD / Month)	Notes

Azure SQL (Premium P4 / 1 TB)	700 â€“ 1,000	Managed RDBMS tier
PostgreSQL (General Purpose 4 vCore / 1 TB)	600 â€“ 900	Slightly lower cost than SQL Server
Azure Functions (Consumption Plan)	50 â€“ 150	Compute on demand
Storage (Blob + Backup)	100 â€“ 200	Data + logs
Total Estimate (SQL Server)	850 â€“ 1,300 USD / month	
Total Estimate (PostgreSQL)	750 â€“ 1,200 USD / month	


Comparison: SQL Server vs PostgreSQL

Feature	Azure SQL Server	Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Performance Tier	Premium (P series)	General Purpose / Memory Optimized
Phonetic Algorithm Integration	Implemented via T-SQL UDF or CLR	Implemented via pg_trgm + UDF
Fuzzy Matching	Levenshtein custom UDF	Native pg_trgm & similarity() operators
Maintenance Overhead	Lower for teams with SQL expertise	Easier scaling with open-source extensions
Cost at Scale	Slightly higher (~10â€“15 %)	Cheaper for large datasets
Best Use Case	Enterprise environment with existing SQL Server expertise	Open-source friendly teams focusing on text search

10. Executive Summary

Key Insight	Takeaway

Azure AI Search delivers enterprise-grade search but is cost-prohibitive at > 1 B records.	$2 K â€“ $4 K/month
Elastic Cloud on Azure offers similar Lucene-based capabilities at ~50 % lower cost.	$1.5 K â€“ $2.2 K/month
Solr & RedisSearch provide flexibility and speed for specialized use cases.	$0.8 K â€“ $1.9 K/month
Azure Function + SQL/PostgreSQL enables a pure PaaS, low-TCO solution suitable for internal apps or PoCs.	$0.75 K â€“ $1.3 K/month


Recommendation:
Start with Azure Function + PostgreSQL PoC, validate accuracy and latency, and scale to Elastic Cloud on Azure if enterprise-grade throughput is required.

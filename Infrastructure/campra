The conversation details the successful migration of the "Real Info" application from AWS to the Property Inside (PI) environment, highlighting the challenges encountered due to the application's monolithic architecture, Oracle database, and vulnerabilities, and the solutions implemented, such as using a reverse proxy.
1. Project Overview and Objectives
Acquisition and Migration Goal:
PI acquired the "Real Info" product, aiming to migrate its AWS-hosted application to the PI environment.
The primary objective was to move the .NET application from AWS to PI and then decommission the AWS environment.
The plan involved migrating the "Real Info" application to PI and subsequently closing down the original application.
Initial State of the Application:
The source code was in .NET, and the database was Oracle, with schema and tables provided.
The application was monolithic, lacking clear separation between data access and business logic.
The application used direct dynamic SQL queries instead of stored procedures for database calls.
2. Challenges Encountered During Migration
Technical Challenges:
The first challenge involved migrating the Oracle schema to SQL, a significant database conversion task.
The application's monolithic structure posed deployment problems due to the lack of clear layer separation.
The absence of distinct web and application layers meant everything was hosted on the web, hindering proper deployment.
Security and Business Vulnerabilities:
The application, being in production for 45 days, had accumulated approximately 300 vulnerabilities that required fixing.
A business expectation was to complete development within 6-8 months to avoid the closure of the AWS application.
Failure to meet the deadline would result in the loss of the application if the AWS environment was shut down.
3. Solutions and Presentation Requirements
Solutions Implemented:
A reverse proxy was utilized to act as a "fake API," facilitating communication between components.
The team successfully addressed and closed out the identified vulnerabilities within the application.
The migration successfully moved the application to the PI environment, now showing "PITP" as Property Inside.
Presentation Requirements for Crawley:
The presentation to Crawley needs to start with a brief description of the "Real Info" application, including its URL.
The title slide should be "Successful Migration of Real Info Application to Property Inside."
The presentation should detail business expectations, challenges faced, and how these challenges were overcome.

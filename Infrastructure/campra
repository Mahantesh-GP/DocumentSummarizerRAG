 Keyword (Text) Search
This is also known as lexical search or classic search. It matches exact words in the user’s query with the indexed terms in documents.

✅ Pros:
Fast and inexpensive.

Supports advanced filtering ($filter, facets, scoring profiles).

Great when users know exact terms to look for (e.g., policy number, title, address).

Predictable behavior (you know why a match came up).

❌ Cons:
Doesn’t understand semantic meaning.

Fails with synonyms, paraphrases, typos.

Ranks based on term frequency not relevance or meaning.

Poor for long, natural queries like "Who is the seller of the property located at...?"


Semantic Search (with Azure Cognitive Search)
This leverages deep learning embeddings and natural language understanding behind the scenes.

✅ Pros:
Understands intent and meaning, not just literal words.

Better for long-form, question-like queries.

Handles synonyms, related phrases (e.g., “closing date” ≈ “settlement date”).

Can use semantic scoring, improving document relevance.

❌ Cons:
Slightly slower than keyword search.

Needs Semantic Configuration in the index (language, captions, etc.).

Doesn’t support $filter, sorting, and facets out of the box (you need hybrid for that).

Can feel “black box” — less transparent scoring.




Why in your case both feel the same?
Short, keyword-like queries: If you’re using queries like "policy number" or "John Doe" — both will behave similarly.

Small data volume: If your index is small or well-labeled, keyword search might retrieve top documents anyway.

Semantic config might be shallow: If your semanticConfig doesn't enable captions or key fields (like documentContent), the benefit is minimal.

You haven’t used semantic reranker yet: Azure semantic search has two modes:

Semantic search only (less impactful)

Vector search + reranker (hybrid) — this is much better




 When you'll see real benefit from Semantic Search

Use Case Example	Why Semantic Helps
“Show me policy details for the property closed in March 2022”	Semantic understands relationships and time ranges
“Who is the buyer of this document?”	It knows that "buyer" = "purchaser"
“Summarize all policies related to mortgage”	It semantically finds relevant documents










viewModel.RelevanceLabel = result.Score switch
        {
            >= 4 => "High Relevance",
            >= 2 => "Medium Relevance",
            _ => "Low Relevance"
        };

return chunks
        .GroupBy(c => c.DocumentId)
        .Select(g => new DocumentResultViewModel
        {
            DocumentName = g.First().DocumentName,
            MaxScore = g.Max(c => c.VectorScore),
            TopChunks = g.OrderByDescending(c => c.VectorScore)
                         .Take(3)
                         .Select(c => c.ChunkText)
                         .ToList(),
            KeyTerms = g.SelectMany(c => c.MatchedTerms)
                        .Distinct()
                        .ToList(),
            RelevanceLabel = g.Max(c => c.VectorScore) switch
            {
                > 0.8 => "High Relevance",
                > 0.5 => "Medium Relevance",
                _ => "Low Relevance"
            }
        })
        .OrderByDescending(d => d.MaxScore)
        .ToList();

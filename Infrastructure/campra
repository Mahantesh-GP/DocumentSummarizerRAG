Key Contributions (Bullets)

Delivered two Proof of Concepts (PoCs) leveraging Azure Cognitive Search:

IGDR PoC – Implemented an indexing pipeline integrating Azure Functions and Azure OpenAI LLM, explored OCR for PDFs, and worked with semantic & vector search.

Name Search PoC – Deep-dived into Azure Search analyzers, experimented with advanced search techniques, and initially explored Knowledge Agent framework before finalizing on traditional Azure Search.


Built strong expertise in Azure Cognitive Search, covering indexing, analyzers, OCR, semantic search, and vector embeddings.

Conducted knowledge-sharing sessions:

GenAI Tech Discussions (Thursdays) – Delivered technical talks for developers and BAs.

GenAI Tech Bridge (Wednesdays) – Simplified GenAI concepts for Business Analysts.


Actively exploring emerging GenAI technologies:

Learning Agentic AI frameworks for real-world applications.

Started ML and Python learning journey to strengthen GenAI and AI-driven solutioning skills.


Actively participated in regular AMA sessions to gain cross-functional knowledge of technologies used across FNF.

Represented the ADM team in FNF Cricket League 2025, contributing to team collaboration and engagement beyond project work.

Summary

Over the last half-year, I advanced my expertise in Azure Cognitive Search and Generative AI technologies through impactful PoCs, hands-on learning, and exploration of indexing pipelines, analyzers, and semantic/vector search. I contributed to a strong knowledge-sharing culture by conducting multiple GenAI sessions for developers and business analysts. Beyond project work, I actively participated in AMA sessions to broaden my technical knowledge and proudly represented the ADM team in the FNF Cricket League 2025, fostering both professional and team engagement.

Key Contributions (Bullets)

Delivered two Proof of Concepts (PoCs) leveraging Azure Cognitive Search:

IGDR PoC ‚Äì Implemented an indexing pipeline integrating Azure Functions and Azure OpenAI LLM, explored OCR for PDFs, and worked with semantic & vector search.

Name Search PoC ‚Äì Deep-dived into Azure Search analyzers, experimented with advanced search techniques, and initially explored Knowledge Agent framework before finalizing on traditional Azure Search.


Built strong expertise in Azure Cognitive Search, covering indexing, analyzers, OCR, semantic search, and vector embeddings.

Conducted knowledge-sharing sessions:

GenAI Tech Discussions (Thursdays) ‚Äì Delivered technical talks for developers and BAs.

GenAI Tech Bridge (Wednesdays) ‚Äì Simplified GenAI concepts for Business Analysts.


Actively exploring emerging GenAI technologies:

Learning Agentic AI frameworks for real-world applications.

Started ML and Python learning journey to strengthen GenAI and AI-driven solutioning skills.

Summary

In the last half-year, I significantly advanced my expertise in Azure Cognitive Search and Generative AI technologies through PoC implementations, hands-on exploration, and deep dives into indexing pipelines, search analyzers, and semantic/vector search. Alongside project work, I contributed to the team‚Äôs learning culture by conducting multiple GenAI technical sessions for both developers and business analysts. Additionally, I have proactively started learning Agentic AI frameworks, Machine Learning, and Python to prepare for future GenAI-driven initiatives.

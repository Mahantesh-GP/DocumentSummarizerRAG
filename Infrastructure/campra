Title: Migration of RealNing Application to PropertyInsight

Business Case: PropertyInsight acquired RealNing and aimed to migrate its legacy application into PI within 6–8 months, moving off the old on‑prem environment.

Key Challenges:

Monolithic .NET/Oracle architecture with poor scalability and modularity.

UI built with Oracle Forms tightly coupled to the business and data layers.

Heavy reliance on Oracle DB; PropertyInsight uses SQL Server.

Large, single‑solution codebase made branching and merging difficult.

Actions Taken:

Implemented a reverse proxy and web application firewall to manage traffic and enhance security.

Refactored code into smaller solutions/modules and upgraded to .NET Standard.

Replaced HQPDF with iTextSharp for report generation and removed Oracle‑specific dependencies.

Planned and executed migration from Oracle DB to SQL Server, including data‑mapping and stored‑procedure conversion.

Established a robust TFS branching/merging strategy and modular deployment process.

Achievements:

Successfully migrated the application within target timeframe; decommissioned the old on‑prem setup.

Cross‑database support enabled; all Oracle dependencies removed.

Reverse proxy load‑balancing handles high traffic; security posture improved.

Codebase re‑organized for easier maintenance, development, and release cycles.

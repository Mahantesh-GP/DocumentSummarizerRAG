Given a personal name (which could be a first name, last name, or both), return a **deduplicated list of common global variations, diminutives, alternate spellings, transliterations, and nicknames**. Consider culturally diverse and English-transliterated forms (e.g., “Alexander” → “Alex”, “Aleksandr”, “Sasha”, “Sandy”, “Saunders”).

Respond only with a **clean, comma-separated list** of variations sorted by relevance. Do not include explanations or extra text.

How billing works
•	It’s billed by RAM size + storage + region.
•	On Azure Marketplace, you choose a plan like:
o	2 GB RAM / 48 GB storage (~$16/mo for dev)
o	16 GB RAM / 480 GB storage (~$120–200/mo for small prod)
o	Scales linearly as you increase node size or replicas.
So you only pay for the compute/storage—no separate Azure VMs, no manual scaling.


Area	Elasticsearch / Elastic Cloud	Azure AI Search
Core engine	Original open-source Lucene (developed by Elastic)	Built on top of Lucene too
Control & tuning	🧠 Full control — you can customize analyzers, phonetic filters, tokenizers, scoring, and synonyms deeply	⚙️ Limited to what Azure exposes in portal/JSON (you can’t add custom plugins)
AI / Enrichment	Needs external orchestration (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Function Apps)	🧩 Built-in “Cognitive Skills” pipeline (OCR, key phrase extraction, sentiment, etc.)
Integration	Works everywhere (Azure, AWS, GCP, on-prem)	Tight integration with Azure ecosystem (Blob, Functions, Cognitive Services)
Management	Elastic Cloud = managed by Elastic (you choose region, size, upgrades)	Fully managed by Microsoft (no backend visibility, but zero ops)
Cost model	Pay per compute/storage (more flexible)	Pay per Search Unit (fixed-size partitions, can get expensive)
Scalability	Horizontal — shards & nodes (fine-grained control)	Partition-based — you must buy entire SUs (less flexible)
Use cases	Complex search, analytics, logging, security, name search, e-commerce	Enterprise search, document enrichment, hybrid AI search
Native AI features	None (but integrates easily with OpenAI, LangChain, etc.)	Built-in Semantic / Vector / Hybrid search (since 2023)
Ease of use	Needs a little setup (Kibana, JSON, SDKs)	Easiest to start (few clicks + portal UI)







Feature	Azure AI Search	Elasticsearch (Elastic Cloud)
Define analyzer per field	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Built-in analyzers (Lucene)	✅ Limited list	✅ Full Lucene library
Custom tokenizers	⚠️ Only from preset list	✅ Any tokenizer (standard, whitespace, regex, pattern, ngram)
Custom token filters	⚠️ Predefined only	✅ Fully customizable (even order & params)
Phonetic filter control	⚠️ Choose algorithm only	✅ Full config (encoder, language, etc.)
Synonym handling	✅ Separate synonym map	✅ Inline or file-based, dynamic reload
Custom plugins	❌ Not allowed	✅ Yes (phonetic, ICU, stemmer, etc.)
Analyze API	✅ Yes (limited info)	✅ Detailed (tokens, positions, graphs)
















Area	Azure AI Search (current)	Elastic Cloud equivalent
Full-text indexing	✔ Built-in	✔ Same (Lucene core)
Custom analyzers	✔ (limited via portal/JSON)	✔ Full Lucene control (define tokenizers, filters, phonetic plugins)
Phonetic analyzer	✔ Pre-enabled (Double Metaphone)	✔ via official phonetic plugin — you enable it per index
Synonym maps	✔ SynonymMap objects	✔ synonym_graph filter — same result
OpenAI nickname expansion	✔ Azure function calls model	✔ You can still call OpenAI (same API) before querying Elastic
Cognitive Skills (OCR, key-phrases, etc.)	✔ integrated skillsets	❌ you’d need your own pipeline (Azure Function or Logic App)
Portal integration / Azure RBAC	✔ tight	⚠ minimal — separate Kibana UI, Elastic RBAC
Query language	simple Lucene syntax	JSON DSL (more flexible but more verbose)











Feature	Elastic Cloud (on Azure)	Azure AI Search
Managed by	Elastic (partner)	Microsoft
Infrastructure	Azure (Elastic deploys inside your region)	Azure native
You manage	Just your indexes & data	Only data (no infra)
Analyzer flexibility	Full Lucene control (phonetic, synonyms, etc.)	Limited predefined analyzers
Integration	Elastic UI (Kibana) + SDKs	Azure Portal, OpenAI, Cognitive Skills
Cost	~30–50% cheaper per GB	Higher but simpler all-in-one pricing
